- QA reports/Low/Non-critical findings: this includes things like code style, clarity, syntax, versioning, off-chain monitoring, state handling, function incorrect as to spec, issues with comments etc. (3/6)

- Medium: Assets not at direct risk, but the function of the protocol or its availability could be impacted, or leak value with a hypothetical attack path with stated assumptions, but external requirements

- High: Assets can be stolen/lost/compromised directly (or indirectly if there is a valid attack path that does not have hand-wavy hypotheticals).
